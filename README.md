# lecture_ripper
lecture_ripper is a tool used to extract all audio from a PowerPoint file and place it all in one m4a audio file.

Have your pesky professors ever uploaded a lecture by placing all of the audio files within the PowerPoint? Well that sure is annoying because then you can't watch the lecture on 2x, 3x or even 4x speed! What you need is lecture_ripper.sh! Simply place lecture_ripper.sh in a folder that contains powerpoint files and it will automatically generate audio files for each powerpoint file!
